## Assignment
Our project is based on the evaluation of three proposed domain adaptation techniques, each for the three categories of Deep Domain Adaptation (Discrepancy-based methods, Adversarial-based methods, Reconstruction-based methods), comparing their performances with respect to the baseline **ResNet50**:

* **Deep CORAL** (*Deep CORrelation ALignment*);
* **DANN** (*Domain Adversarial Neural Network*);
* **DSN** (*Domain Separation Network*).
